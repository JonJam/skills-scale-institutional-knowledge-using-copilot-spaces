# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs projects with a lightweight, outcome-driven process that moves work from idea to delivery through clearly defined initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective stages. New work begins with a Project One-pager to capture the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline; that decision gate determines whether the effort moves into detailed planning. Planning breaks approved initiatives into a prioritized backlog, estimates scope, records dependencies and risks in a risk register, and defines a Definition of Done and acceptance criteria for each backlog item.

Day-to-day execution is organized around a predictable team rhythm: short daily standups for progress and blockers, weekly delivery syncs for progress and risk escalation, and demos or reviews at the end of sprints or milestones. Work is tracked on a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and follows a small-PR, CI-first pull request workflow with required approvals and links back to issues and acceptance criteria. Cross-team dependencies and escalations are explicitly handled through the risk register and a three-level escalation path (team → PM/Product Lead → Sponsor) with template-driven status and incident communications.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, and communications; Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize work, and own success metrics; Developers implement and test; QA validates quality and acceptance. These personas are used to assign ownership for backlog items, risks, action items from retrospectives, and stakeholder communications, ensuring clear accountability across the lifecycle.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout: unit and integration tests for code changes, end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, security scanning in CI, and manual QA where needed. Pre-release checklists (passing CI, release notes, rollback plans, and smoke tests in staging) support safer deployments, and post-release verification plus a blameless incident playbook guide response and learning. Continuous improvement is enforced via regular retrospectives that convert findings into tracked action items in the backlog, with follow-up during weekly PM syncs to measure impact and close the loop.
